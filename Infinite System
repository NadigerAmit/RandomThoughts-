 I always think who is god and who are we ? Am I god my slef ? Is every one god  or god is there in every one .
 I am trying to find answers to these questions , these are easy answers or there is no readymade answer for them .
 
 My current thinking is : 
 
 We are past of unverse , i.e we are parasites on universe , let me say our parent god .
 So we can say parent god is universe which we can see . our parent gods contains all the below things which we see 
 Ex: earth , sun , air , water , sky , humans , trees , animals , various creature , entire solar system , entire galaxy .
 whatever up to which we can imagine is part of our immediate parent god.
 I cant say our parent god is human , tree , animal , creature or what is his shape , etc .
 
 
 Like this we are also god to our parasites , we have our own sytem inside of us.
